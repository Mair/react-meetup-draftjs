The Intent is to provide a tool that will quickly but gently bring someone up to speed everything Draft-js related

Navigating the menu on the left hand side from top to bottom will ensure you cover each topic in a gradient of complexity. 
This will ensure that by the time you get to using complex decorators you have covered all the fundamentals. 
Thereafter it may provide as a convenient reference

This is a work in progress so please put in a pull request if you feel an improvement can be made

This is a typescript project however, if you are using babel with ES6 you will find modifying the code and removing the typingâ€™s to be trivial

*note...  This is a typescript project however, draft-js typings have been ***temporarily***  removed due to waiting for upgrade typings to 0.10*

TODO:

 * in-line styles
 * key board events
 * css cleanup
 * complete documentation
